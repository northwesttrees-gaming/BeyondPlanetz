## About The Modification
### Theme
This modification is a space-based mod that takes inspiration from our solar system. The mod does not focus on it being realistic but rather unique and interesting. 

### Inspiration
Planet names are based on our solar system, though when you arrive on a planet, you will find that there is a unique ecosystem of biomes, plants, and minerals for each dimension. To survive there you will need to progress in research to unlock technology that will give you progression.
